Getting the data
++++++++++++++++

``gilaa`` is a package for processing data from the GALAH survey, which means that to begin using it you need an initial dataset.
Go to the `Data Central TAP Service site <https://datacentral.org.au/vo/tap>` and query for some data you are interested in.
If you are not familiar with query searching, you can go to this `sample queries stie <https://docs.datacentral.org.au/galah/sample-queries/sample-queries-galah-dr2/>` to get started.
Download the data preferably as a .csv file (if you download the file and you can't open it directly, try openning it with a regular text editor and from there save it as a .csv file).

You can download ``gilaa`` straight from ``pip``. 
Run the following in the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

        $ pip install gilaa

The ``gilaa`` package depends on some other well-known packages, so make sure you have ``numpy``, ``pandas`` and ``matplotlib``.

Once you hace everything installed, make sure to visit the quickstart page to, well, get quickstarted.
